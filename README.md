# Introduction
![etl](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f50f740e-3c76-4bd0-937c-060232bf6231)
The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on, practical guide on creating and automating a simple ETL pipeline . Thus, this project hopes to offer a practical way to improve your data engineering skills.

# Tools Used
Python: Programming language for implementing the system.

File Handling: Utilized for reading and writing user information to a CSV file.
# Functionality
Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) involves extracting data from various sources with various types (CSV, Xml, Json) , transforming it into a suitable format, and then loading it into a destination database or data warehouse for further analysis.
## Extract Data from Files
The first step in our ETL pipeline is to extract data from the files containing data. We will use the pandas library to read the files into a DataFrame.
## Transform Data
The next step is to transform the extracted data into the desired format for loading into the Target file . This may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting data types.
## Load Data
The final step is to load the transformed data into the Target file.
# Conclusion
The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on, practical guide on creating and automating a simple ETL pipeline .Thus, this project hopes to offer a practical way to improve your data engineering skills.

But the adventure doesnâ€™t end there. data can be used for a variety of analytical purposes and provides valuable insight into user behavior.
