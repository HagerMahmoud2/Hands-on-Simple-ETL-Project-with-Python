# Hands-on-Simple-ETL-Project-with-Python
# Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on, practical guide on creating and automating a simple ETL pipeline . Thus, this project hopes to offer a practical way to improve your data engineering skills.
# Tools Used
Python: Programming language for implementing the system.

File Handling: Utilized for reading and writing user information to a CSV file.
# Functionality
## Extract Data from Files
he first step in our ETL pipeline is to extract data from the files containing data. We will use the pandas library to read the files into a DataFrame.
## Transform Data
The next step is to transform the extracted data into the desired format for loading into the Target file . This may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting data types.
## Load Data
The final step is to load the transformed data into the Target file.
